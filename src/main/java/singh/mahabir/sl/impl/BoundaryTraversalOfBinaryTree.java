   1. Print the left boundary in top-down manner.
   2. Print all leaf nodes from left to right, which can again be sub-divided into two sub-parts:
    …..2.1 Print all leaf nodes of left sub-tree from left to right.
    …..2.2 Print all leaf nodes of right subtree from left to right.
   3. Print the right boundary in bottom-up manner.
